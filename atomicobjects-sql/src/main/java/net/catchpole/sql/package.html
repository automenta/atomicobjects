This package is a light weight, high-performance, reflective persistence
layer. It differs from some persistence layers in that it operates from database meta data,
creating schema information automatically at runtime. It is also designed to be utilized by
the core API, and therefor is not focused on providing object relational mapping for direct
developer use. Rather, it maintains state as tabular, relational data.
